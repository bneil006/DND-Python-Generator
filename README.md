<strong>After 53 commits it's time for an update to the README.md</strong><br>

I started this project to learn Python, I already knew some of the fundementals and went on a journey to continue learning past that<br>
with Boot.dev, after the first 4 courses and learning OOP or learning of OOP from those courses I set out to create something of my own.<br>

I have since created a 5e NPC generator that creates simple named npcs with an assortment of details,<br>
have created my first RESTful API with FastAPI and I have created a front end with HTML, CSS & JS.

My learning and experimenting took me down the road of creating my first heroku application and then getting<br>
my first url and website, learning how to use the CLI properly (Mostly i hope.) and how to debug and restructure my<br>
code though I have a seriously long journey ahead of me to actually become okay at any of that. <br><br>

My Goal now is to take the knowledge I've gained and continue down this path until I feel I know it inside and out.<br>

I started off wanting to learn more about Python and am finding I want to learn more about developement in general, front and back end.<br>
Next on this list of things to do is flesh out more of the backend functionality to be the way I want it to be, work on the RESTful API<br>
endpoints to make sure those are good and then to continue onto jumping to the front end. If I can marry together the front and back end<br>
I think I can be proud of what I've made and accomplished. I never thought I'd get this far and in such a quick time ether.<br>
