# DND-Python-Generator
This is a project I'm working on to learn and improve my Python, while also
creating a project that I would like to use.

<b>STEPS:</b>
1. Make a simple NPC generator (Race & Classes)
    * NPC Should have a Race & Class
    * NPC Should be stored in an Array or Dict

2. Give NPC's Stats (Personality and Equipment)
    * Create a Stat block for all NPC's in the Generator
    * Generic Background to be updated later on
    * Generic Equipment to be updated later on

<b>I'm starting with the above goals in mind and will expand if I can achieve those</b></n>
Right now I'll be using the README.md as my goal tracker, this will help me keep track
of my goals as I make commits to Github and will inevitably change as time goes on,
if I keep it here, I think it will help me when I look back. Not sure how other developers
handle things of this nature or what best practices are for keeping track of goals etc.
